# Project: 0x05. Processes and Signals

## Overview

This project delves into the fundamentals of processes and signals, providing essential knowledge and practical tasks related to process management and signal handling. Understanding the concepts covered in this project is crucial for effective system administration and software development.

## Key Concepts

### PID (Process ID)

- **Definition:** PID stands for Process ID, a unique numerical identifier assigned to each running process on a system.
- **Knowledge Points:**
  - Identification of processes through PIDs.
  - Locating the PID of a process.

### Process

- **Definition:** A process is an independent program in execution, comprising a set of instructions and resources.
- **Knowledge Points:**
  - Understanding the nature of processes.
  - Listing and managing processes.

### Signal

- **Definition:** A signal is a software interrupt delivered to a process, notifying it to perform a specific action.
- **Knowledge Points:**
  - Recognizing the purpose and significance of signals.
  - Sending signals to control processes.
