# Web stack debugging #4

This was the fourth installment in a series of web stack debugging tasks. In these projects, I received malfunctioning web stacks within isolated containers and was responsible for restoring them to a functional state. For each assignment, I developed a script to automate the necessary commands to rectify the issues in the web stack.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Pushing the Limits**
  * [0-the_sky_is_the_limit_not.pp](./0-the_sky_is_the_limit_not.pp): Puppet manifest designed to increase the capacity of an Apache web server to handle traffic effectively.

* **1. User Access**
  * [1-user_limit.pp](./1-user_limit.pp): Puppet manifest aimed at modifying the operating system configuration to allow successful login with the `holberton` user and file access without encountering errors.
