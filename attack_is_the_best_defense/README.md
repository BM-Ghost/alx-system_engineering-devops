# Attack is the Best Defense

In the realm of cybersecurity, the axiom "attack is the best defense" rings true, highlighting the importance of comprehending attackers' methodologies and tactics to safeguard ourselves and our systems against potential threats.

Contained within this repository are two tasks which delve into distinct attack methodologies: 0-sniffing and 1-dictionary_attack. Both tasks aim to provide you with a more profound insight into the operational methods of attackers and effective defensive measures.

## Task 0: Sniffing
Task 0 delves into the concept of packet sniffing, a technique frequently utilized by attackers to intercept and scrutinize network traffic. By capturing packets traversing the network, attackers can illicitly obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card numbers.

In this task, you'll become acquainted with Wireshark, a widely-used packet sniffing tool, enabling you to capture and analyze network traffic. Additionally, you'll acquire knowledge about various network protocols and their susceptibilities to exploitation by malicious actors.

## Task 1: Dictionary Attack
Task 1 explores the concept of a dictionary attack, a form of brute force attack where assailants employ a predefined list of words or phrases (a "dictionary") to guess passwords.

In this task, you'll learn how to craft a basic dictionary attack script using Python. Furthermore, you'll gain insights into password security practices, including the creation of robust passwords that resist dictionary attacks.

## Conclusion
Completion of these tasks promises a deeper understanding of offensive and defensive strategies within the cybersecurity domain. It underscores the notion that while offense may serve as an effective defense, true resilience lies in our ability to defend against potential attacks.
